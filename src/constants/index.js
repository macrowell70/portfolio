    "My name is Mitch. I am a web developer and software engineer dedicated to writing efficient, readable, and scalable code while creating new and exciting software.",
    "Since March of 2022, I have been on a journey to improve my life with a career in web and software development. To begin my journey I began a full stack development course with Bloom Institute of Technology. That course awarded me a wide breadth of knowledge in languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python, as well as frameworks like React, Node, Redux, SaSS, Less, Express and others. I have received training in developing front end and back end components, as well as first hand experience with Symantic HTML, advanced design principals, agile project management, SDLC, RESTful APIs, deployment, GitHub, authentication and authorization.",
    "Now I am embarking on the next part of the process to find my next exciting career in tech while continuing my education. I am interested in both front end and back end development. I have a background in banking, as well as a degree in economics, and I would love to find a position in the financial services industry. My unique perspective as an end user of much of the software in banking gives me the ability to design products with the best interest of those users in mind.",
    "I hope to soon find an employer that will help me in my growth as a developer while providing them with top knotch software."
